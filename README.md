TOP Foundations Course Project: Landing Page

This project to replicate (most of) the brief took me a little under 3 hours from start to finish.

Not done:
- making the font roboto

Could be done better:
- grouping elements in css
    eg. having a main container element that shares the same sizing properties


Next steps would be to insert customisations so it's not so basic.
- images (background, placeholder)
- links to other project(s), bio
